I look forward to years of peace and prosperity between our peoples." - Whitestone Head Historian Isaiah Rexam\n'+
                   '"I worry at times about our relationship with the Dwaerren, not due to any fault of their own, but rather that they represent so much that humanity strives for: the priests admire their stoicism, the nobles their structure, the merchants their acumen, and the commoner their apparent contentment. Yet we ignore that the Dwaerren are not all identical, that they experience change and growth and sloth and doubt. In addition, we refuse to grow in the ways we profess to admire in others. This type of idolization can never be healthy." - Guildmaster Jonath Oldbridge of the Archaeological Society\n'+
                   '"My people are the rock, strong, formidable, a foundation on which the world rests. My people are the mine, hollow, cold, only respected for what it provides to the overworld. My people are the seed, hard, yet full of life, destined to grow and burst out of the underground. We are underestimated by the outside world, and the time for reckoning is at hand. The Dwaerren must grow, or we will be buried." - Argos, Dwaerren Heretic'

Her gamble paid off however, at the cost of her own life. She knew that the lack of access to the wild magics of nature might drain her powers over time, but in addition her followers unknowingly fed on her life force instead of being sustained by natural energy. They adapted and grew stronger over time even without wild magic to innervate their bodies, and have maintained the longest lasting society in all of Diamorti.\n"+
                  "The term Dwaerren comes from the Stonetongue adjective 'blessed by the earth', which was frequently used as 'one who is blessed by the earth', leading to the unusual pluralization and variations in their name"

It is run by a hereditary oligarchy of royals advised by three legislative bodies- one comprised of lesser nobles, one of traders, and one of the miners, warriors, and other working-class. After the nobles, the traders living within the mountain are the highest rank, followed by the clerics and miners, followed by the warriors, followed by traders living outside the mountain. However, warriors and traders have the highest opportunity to advance into the nobility through merit and glory, while the middle class of clerics and miners tend to be generations-long internal societies with their own laws and hierarchies. That being said, dwarves by nature are not particularly ambitious, seeking only to serve their family and nation. The oddballs that diverge from this quickly find themselves stationed outside the mountainhome, travelling outside to other places and serving as either liaisons or adventurers, or a little bit of both."
