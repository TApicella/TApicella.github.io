			text:  '"I must confess, my earlier writings on the Wildfolk were, bluntly, full of anger and bile. It is true that they were largely responsible for the fall of Drakkengard, and I cannot for an instant imagine living life in the woods, surrounded by magic. Yet despite their savagery, I have grown to accept our differences. I have had the opportunity to speak with many of their elders of late, and I admire much of their art and music. In time, I hope we can bring civilization to them and accept them as brothers and sisters." - Whitestone Head Historian Isaiah Rexam\n'+
                   '"In my youth I spent a great deal of time with the Wildfolk, looking for ruins and ancient artifacts. At first, like most people, I assumed they were savages, but that could not be farther from the truth. Their culture is rich and vibrant, their magic as sophisticated as our technology, and their drive and discipline as impressive as that of the dwaerren. Over time, I forayed less into dusty ruins, choosing to remain and learn from the Wildfolk instead, and I consider that time well spent. I will concede however that few things terrify me to this day more than the raw unpredictability of a Wildfolk adolescent" - Guildmaster Jonath Oldbridge of the Archaeological Society\n'+

			text:  "Just as the dwaerren were created by the goddess Erthys leading them deep into the mountains, the wildfolk were born when the god Sadhef led his followers deep into the forests. Having found his Shard of godhood at the intersection of leylines, he became convinced the best way to survive the apocalypse was to embrace the raw magic rather than flee it. His intuition was correct in a way- the trees soaked the seeping magic of the earth through their roots and grew to massive heights, diffusing the energy enough to quell the surges of energy and raging tremors. Sadhef\'s followers were massively irradiated with magic, and while many went mad or died, the survivors grew strong, nimble, and deeply in tune with mana.\n"+
                   "For many years Sadhef led his people in wars against Drakkengard\'s humans and their cold cities, but after the Prophet\'s death and the dark ages that followed, Sadhef withdrew from the physical realm to avoid interfering with mortal affairs. He encouraged the Wildfolk to end the senseless fighting with the humans, and as they recovered from the wars, both races were able to prosper and coexist more or less peacefully. The Wildfolk are still fairly impulsive and capricious, but far more cooperative with others than in the past."

			text:  "Wildfolk society is very loose in governance, but culturally Wildfolk are very reverent towards elders and those who have done great deeds. Puberty is frequently the onset of magical mutations and intense changes in youths, and leads to rage and impetuous behavior. If they survive both the mutation and the likelihood of self destructive behavior, they are considered adults and immediately get full rights within the community. There still exists a military traditions, but herbalists and artists are considered just as worthy and honorable as warriors.\n"+   
                   "Although it\'s not uncommon for wildfolk to travel, they effectively never settle down outside the forests of the Wildlands, living in villages that stretch from the ground to the treetops, with little flags and banners sticking up over the canopy marking the territory of various clans. The clans bicker, but rarely actually war with each other. Instead, it is more common for clans to swap members: artisans move to the wealthier and more powerful clans, while warriors move to the weaker clans where they can get more recognition, which over time lets them become more powerful than their neighbors."
