We have promoted technology yet shunned magic, and so our progress is limited to the physical world and access to resources. And we have tied our standards of success to gold rather than accomplishment, which I fear will cripple the common people’s ability to better themselves. We must learn from the rest of the world, before it is too late." - Guildmaster Jonath Oldbridge of the Archaeological Society\n'+

			text: "Most scholars agree prior to the Cataclysm, humanity was the only race of Diamorti, and it was that influx of magic that split off and rapidly evolved the other races to their current state, although a smattering of others disagree. Regardless, humans do tend towards being more adaptive than other races and have founded many of the permanent settlements on the continent. The vast majority live along the coastlines, with the two major predominantly human cities being Corstaz in the southeast and Whitestone on the southern coast, with small trade cities dotting the landscape between them.\n"+
                  "There are also small settlements bordering some of the other trading nations, primarily along the Deepstone Mountains, the Keldara Desert outskirts, and the northern coastlines by the merfolk territories. Few humans have settled in the western side of the continent, but Whitestone\'s leadership has started to make plans to rectify that issue, particularly since Corstaz\'s influence has surpassed that of the older city."
